## The Mission
So we talked about Pastéis de Nata, that made you hungry huh? Don't lie, everybody saw it!
If you really were not, then look at this picture for five minutes straight and come back.

Unfortunately, there is only one left... we will make a little game to decide who will get it.
If a player guesses a secret number, he or she wins it!

> Okay, if you still pretend not to be hungry - just imagine the prize is a banana 🍌 (careful, can be an angry one)

### Must-have features
- A secret number will be generated. To make things fair, the number should be between 1 and (learners in the class)
- A user can enter a guess (what html element can be useful for this?)
- When he or she pushes the "play" button, the number will be compared to the secret number
- Depending on the outcome, an alert box will show:
    - Awesome! You number (actual number) was correct. You can be named many things, hungry not being one of them.
    - Bummer... You guessed (guess) and the secret number was (secret number).
    
### Nice-to-have features
When a guess was just one number from the secret number, show another message: "So close, but you just missed it! Are you in a class that started on the thirteenth or what?"
